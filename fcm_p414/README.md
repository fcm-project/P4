# P4-14 Source Code

In this repository, the prototype P4 source code is written in P4-14, and compiled using version 8.2.0 of BF_SDE.

The p4-14 implementations are currently only for updating counts. They do not support in-network queries. But, you can easily get the in-network query (flow size, classification of heavy hitters, cardinality estimation) from the returned register values.
